      The `[myrpki]` section contains all the parameters that you
      really need to configure.  The name `myrpki` is historical and
      may change in the future.

    <option name  = "handle">
      <doc>
	Every resource-holding or server-operating entity needs a
	"handle", which is just an identifier by which the entity
	calls itself.  Handles do not need to be globally unique, but
	should be chosen with an eye towards debugging operational
	problems: it's best if you use a handle that your parents and
	children will recognize as being you.
       </doc>
      <doc>
        The `handle` option in the `[myrpki]` section specifies the
	default handle for this installation.  Previous versions of
	the CA tools required a separate configuration file, each with
	its own handle setting, for each hosted entity.  The current
	code allows the current handle to be selected at runtime in
	both the GUI and command line user interface tools, so the
	handle setting here is just the default when you don't set one
	explictly.  In the long run, this option may go away entirely,
	but for now you need to set this.
      </doc>
      <doc>
	Syntax is an identifier (ASCII letters, digits, hyphen,
        underscore -- no whitespace, non-ASCII characters, or other

      <doc>
        Whether you want to run your own copy of pubd.  In general,
        it's best to use your parent's pubd if your parent allows you
        to do so, because this will reduce the overall number of
        publication sites from which relying parties will need to
        retrieve data.  However, not all parents offer publication
        service, or you may need to run pubd yourself for reliability
        reasons, or because you're certifying private address space or
        private Autonomous System Numbers.

        Root of directory tree where pubd should write out published data.
        You need to configure this, and the configuration should match up
        with the directory where you point rsyncd.  Neither pubd nor rsyncd
        much cares -where- you tell them to put this stuff, the important
        thing is that the rsync URIs in generated certificates match up
        with the published objects so that relying parties can find and
        verify rpkid's published outputs.

      You don't need to run rootd unless you're IANA, are certifying
      private address space, or are an RIR which refuses to accept IANA as
      the root of the public address hierarchy.
    </doc>

    <doc>
      Ok, if that wasn't enough to scare you off: rootd is a mess, and
      needs to be rewritten, or, better, merged into rpkid.  It
      doesn't use the publication protocol, and it requires far too
      many configuration parameters.
    </doc>

    <doc>
      rootd was originally intended to be a very simple program which
      simplified rpkid enormously by moving one specific task (acting
      as the root CA of an RPKI certificate hierarchy) out of rpkid.
      As the specifications and code (mostly the latter) have evolved,
      however, this task has become more complicated, and rootd would
      have to become much more complicated to keep up.
    </doc>
    
    <doc>
      Don't run rootd unless you're sure that you need to do so.
