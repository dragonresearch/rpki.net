    <doc>
      The "`[myrpki]`" section contains all the parameters that you
      really need to configure.  The name "`myrpki`" is historical and
      may change in the future.
    </doc>

    <option name  = "handle">
      <doc>
	Every resource-holding or server-operating entity needs a
	"handle", which is just an identifier by which the entity
	calls itself.  Handles do not need to be globally unique, but
	should be chosen with an eye towards debugging operational
	problems: it's best if you use a handle that your parents and
	children will recognize as being you.
       </doc>
      <doc>
        The "`handle`" option in the "`[myrpki]`" section specifies the
	default handle for this installation.  Previous versions of
	the CA tools required a separate configuration file, each with
	its own handle setting, for each hosted entity.  The current
	code allows the current handle to be selected at runtime in
	both the GUI and command line user interface tools, so the
	handle setting here is just the default when you don't set one
	explictly.  In the long run, this option may go away entirely,
	but for now you need to set this.
      </doc>
      <doc>
	Syntax is an identifier (ASCII letters, digits, hyphen,
        underscore -- no whitespace, non-ASCII characters, or other
        punctuation).

    <option name  = "rpkid_server_host">
      <doc>
        DNS hostname for rpkid.  In most cases, this must resolve to a

    <option name  = "run_pubd"
            value = "yes">
      <doc>
        Whether you want to run your own copy of pubd.  In general,
        it's best to use your parent's pubd if your parent allows you
        to do so, because this will reduce the overall number of
        publication sites from which relying parties will need to
        retrieve data.  However, not all parents offer publication
        service, or you may need to run pubd yourself for reliability
        reasons, or because you're certifying private address space or
        private Autonomous System Numbers.
      </doc>
      <doc>
	The out of band setup protocol will attempt to negotiate
	publication service for you with whatever publication service

      <doc>
        Contact information to include in offers of repository

        server (usually Apache) that serves the RRDP files.  Neither
