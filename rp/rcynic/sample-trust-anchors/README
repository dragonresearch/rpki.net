These are SAMPLE trust anchors for testing rcynic.  Any resemblance
between these files and real trust anchors living, dead, or wandering
the night in ghostly torment is purely coincidental.

Remember: it's only a trust anchor if a replying party says it is.
You are the relying party, so it's your call.

The .cer files (if any) are self-signed X.509 trust anchors.

The .tal files are "trust anchor locators", see RFC 6490.

See the rcynic documentation for further details.
