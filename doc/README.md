# Documentation for the Dragon Research Labs rpki.net RPKI toolkit

Documentation is currently undergoing revision, albeit in fits and starts.

## Quick Start Guides

Quick Start guides for Relying Party and CA on Ubuntu Xenial are
[here](doc/quickstart/README.md)

## (Old) User's Manual

The [User's Manual](manual/).  This is old, and corresponds, roughly,
to the `old-trunk` branch.  Portions of it are now obsolete, but it
may still be useful as a general guide to some of the more obscure
bits of the software.

If you find a place where the code and the manual disagree, the code
is probably right.

## Wiki dump

[Content salvaged from old trac.rpki.net wiki](wiki-dump/).  This is
mostly for archival, although some pieces of it may still be directly
useful.

## Internals documentation

Not written yet.  At one point we experimented with Doxygen, but the
results were not particularly useful.  But that was years ago, and
Doxygen has undergone a lot of development since that time, so it
might be worth another try.
