Left-right protocol

   The left-right protocol is really two separate client/server protocols
   over separate channels between the RPKI engine and the IR back end
   (IRBE).

   The IRBE is the client for one of the subprotocols, the RPKI engine is
   the client for the other.

Terminology

     * IRBE: Internet Registry Back End

     * IRDB: Internet Registry Data Base

     * BPKI: Business PKI

     * RPKI: Resource PKI

initiated by the IRBE

   This part of the protcol uses a kind of message-passing. Each object
   that the RPKI engine knows about takes five messages: "create", "set",
   "get", "list", and "destroy". Actions which are not just data
   operations on objects are handled via an SNMP-like mechanism, as if
   they were fields to be set. For example, to generate a keypair one
   "sets" the "generate-keypair" field of a BSC object, even though there
   is no such field in the object itself as stored in SQL. This is a bit
   of a kludge, but the reason for doing it as if these were variables
   being set is to allow composite operations such as creating a BSC,
   populating all of its data fields, and generating a keypair, all as a
   single operation. With this model, that's trivial, otherwise it's at
   least two round trips.

   Fields can be set in either "create" or "set" operations, the
   difference just being whether the object already exists. A "get"
   operation returns all visible fields of the object. A "list" operation
   returns a list containing what "get" would have returned on each of
   those objects.

   Left-right protocol objects are encoded as signed CMS messages
   containing XML as eContent and using an eContentType OID of id-ct-xml
   (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.28). These CMS messages are in turn passed as
   the data for HTTPS POST operations, with an HTTP content type of
   "application/x-rpki" for both the POST data and the response data.

   All operations allow an optional "tag" attribute which can be any
   alphanumeric token. The main purpose of the tag attribute is to allow
   batching of multiple requests into a single PDU.

<self/> object

   A <self/> object represents one virtual RPKI engine. In simple cases
   where the RPKI engine operator operates the engine only on their own
   behalf, there will only be one <self/> object, representing the engine
   operator's organization, but in environments where the engine operator
   hosts other entities, there will be one <self/> object per hosted
   entity (probably including the engine operator's own organization,
   considered as a hosted customer of itself).

   Some of the RPKI engine's configured parameters and data are shared by
   all hosted entities, but most are tied to a specific <self/> object.
   Data which are shared by all hosted entities are referred to as
   "per-engine" data, data which are specific to a particular <self/>
   object are "per-self" data.

   Since all other RPKI engine objects refer to a <self/> object via a
   "self_handle" value, one must create a <self/> object before one can
   usefully configure any other left-right protocol objects.

   Every <self/> object has a self_handle attribute, which must be
   specified for the "create", "set", "get", and "destroy" actions.

   Payload data which can be configured in a <self/> object:
     * use_hsm (attribute): Whether to use a Hardware Signing Module. At
       present this option has no effect, as the implementation does not
       yet support HSMs.

     * crl_interval (attribute): Positive integer representing the planned
       lifetime of an RPKI CRL for this <self/>, measured in seconds.

     * regen_margin (attribute): Positive integer representing how long
       before expiration of an RPKI certificiate a new one should be
       generated, measured in seconds. At present this only affects the
       one-off EE certificates associated with ROAs.

     * bpki_cert (element): BPKI CA certificate for this <self/>. This is
       used as part of the certificate chain when validating incoming TLS
       and CMS messages, and should be the issuer of cross-certification
       BPKI certificates used in <repository/>, <parent/>, and <child/>
       objects. If the bpki_glue certificate is in use (below), the
       bpki_cert certificate should be issued by the bpki_glue
       certificate; otherwise, the bpki_cert certificate should be issued
       by the per-engine bpki_ta certificate.

     * bpki_glue (element): Another BPKI CA certificate for this <self/>,
       usually not needed. Certain pathological cross-certification cases
       require a two-certificate chain due to issuer name conflicts. If
       used, the bpki_glue certificate should be the issuer of the
       bpki_cert certificate and should be issued by the per-engine
       bpki_ta certificate; if not needed, the bpki_glue certificate
       should be left unset.

   Control attributes that can be set to "yes" to force actions:
     * rekey: Start a key rollover for every RPKI CA associated with every
       <parent/> object associated with this <self/> object. This is the
       first phase of a key rollover operation.

     * revoke: Revoke any remaining certificates for any expired key
       associated with any RPKI CA for any <parent/> object associated
       with this <self/> object. This is the second (cleanup) phase for a
       key rollover operation; it's separate from the first phase to leave
       time for new RPKI certificates to propegate and be installed.

     * reissue: Not implemented, may be removed from protocol. Original
       theory was that this operation would force reissuance of any object
       with a changed key, but as that happens automatically as part of
       the key rollover mechanism this operation seems unnecessary.

     * run_now: Force immediate processing for all tasks associated with
       this <self/> object that would ordinarily be performed under cron.
       Not currently implemented.

     * publish_world_now: Force (re)publication of every publishable
       object for this <self/> object. Not currently implemented. Intended
       to aid in recovery if RPKI engine and publication engine somehow
       get out of sync.

<bsc/> object

   The <bsc/> ("business signing context") object represents all the BPKI
   data needed to sign outgoing CMS or HTTPS messages. Various other
   objects include pointers to a <bsc/> object. Whether a particular
   <self/> uses only one <bsc/> or multiple is a configuration decision
   based on external requirements: the RPKI engine code doesn't care, it
   just cares that, for any object representing a relationship for which
   it must sign messages, there be a <bsc/> object that it can use to
   produce that signature.

   Every <bsc/> object has a bsc_handle, which must be specified for the
   "create", "get", "set", and "destroy" actions. Every <bsc/> also has a
   self_handle attribute which indicates the <self/> object with which
   this <bsc/> object is associated.

   Payload data which can be configured in a <isc/> object:
     * signing_cert (element): BPKI certificate to use when generating a
       signature.

     * signing_cert_crl (element): CRL which would list signing_cert if it
       had been revoked.

   Control attributes that can be set to "yes" to force actions:
     * generate_keypair: Generate a new BPKI keypair and return a PKCS #10
       certificate request. The resulting certificate, once issued, should
       be configured as this <bsc/> object's signing_cert.

   Additional attributes which may be specified when specifying
   "generate_keypair":
     * key_type: Type of BPKI keypair to generate. "rsa" is both the
       default and, at the moment, the only allowed value.

     * hash_alg: Cryptographic hash algorithm to use with this keypair.
       "sha256" is both the default and, at the moment, the only allowed
       value.

     * key_length: Length in bits of the keypair to be generated. "2048"
       is both the default and, at the moment, the only allowed value.

   Replies to "create" and "set" actions that specify "generate-keypair"
   include a <bsc_pkcs10/> element, as do replies to "get" and "list"
   actions for a <bsc/> object for which a "generate-keypair" command has
   been issued. The RPKI engine stores the PKCS #10 request, which allows
   the IRBE to reuse the request if and when it needs to reissue the
   corresponding BPKI signing certificate.

<parent/> object

   The <parent/> object represents the RPKI engine's view of a particular
   parent of the current <self/> object in the up-down protocol. Due to
   the way that the resource hierarchy works, a given <self/> may obtain
   resources from multiple parents, but it will always have at least one;
   in the case of IANA or an RIR, the parent RPKI engine may be a trivial
   stub.

   Every <parent/> object has a parent_handle, which must be specified for
   the "create", "get", "set", and "destroy" actions. Every <parent/> also
   has a self_handle attribute which indicates the <self/> object with
   which this <parent/> object is associated, a bsc_handle attribute
   indicating the <bsc/> object to be used when signing messages sent to
   this parent, and a repository_handle indicating the <repository/>
   object to be used when publishing issued by the certificate issued by
   this parent.

   Payload data which can be configured in a <parent/> object:
     * peer_contact_uri (attribute): HTTPS URI used to contact this
       parent.

     * sia_base (attribute): The leading portion of an rsync URI that the
       RPKI engine should use when composing the publication URI for
       objects issued by the RPKI certificate issued by this parent.

     * sender_name (attribute): Sender name to use in the up-down protocol
       when talking to this parent. The RPKI engine doesn't really care
       what this value is, but other implementations of the up-down
       protocol do care.

     * recipient_name (attribute): Recipient name to use in the up-down
       protocol when talking to this parent. The RPKI engine doesn't
       really care what this value is, but other implementations of the
       up-down protocol do care.

     * bpki_cms_cert (element): BPKI CMS CA certificate for this
       <parent/>. This is used as part of the certificate chain when
       validating incoming CMS messages If the bpki_cms_glue certificate
       is in use (below), the bpki_cms_cert certificate should be issued
       by the bpki_cms_glue certificate; otherwise, the bpki_cms_cert
       certificate should be issued by the bpki_cert certificate in the
       <self/> object.

     * bpki_cms_glue (element): Another BPKI CMS CA certificate for this
       <parent/>, usually not needed. Certain pathological
       cross-certification cases require a two-certificate chain due to
       issuer name conflicts. If used, the bpki_cms_glue certificate
       should be the issuer of the bpki_cms_cert certificate and should be
       issued by the bpki_cert certificate in the <self/> object; if not
       needed, the bpki_cms_glue certificate should be left unset.

     * bpki_https_cert (element): BPKI HTTPS CA certificate for this
       <parent/>. This is like the bpki_cms_cert object, only used for
       validating incoming TLS messages rather than CMS.

     * bpki_cms_glue (element): Another BPKI HTTPS CA certificate for this
       <parent/>, usually not needed. This is like the bpki_cms_glue
       certificate, only used for validating incoming TLS messages rather
       than CMS.

   Control attributes that can be set to "yes" to force actions:
     * rekey: This is like the rekey command in the <self/> object, but
       limited to RPKI CAs under this parent.

     * reissue: This is like the reissue command in the <self/> object,
       but limited to RPKI CAs under this parent.

     * revoke: This is like the revoke command in the <self/> object, but
       limited to RPKI CAs under this parent.

<child/> object

   The <child/> object represents the RPKI engine's view of particular
   child of the current <self/> in the up-down protocol.

   Every <child/> object has a child_handle, which must be specified for
   the "create", "get", "set", and "destroy" actions. Every <child/> also
   has a self_handle attribute which indicates the <self/> object with
   which this <child/> object is associated.

   Payload data which can be configured in a <child/> object:
     * bpki_cert (element): BPKI CA certificate for this <child/>. This is
       used as part of the certificate chain when validating incoming TLS
       and CMS messages. If the bpki_glue certificate is in use (below),
       the bpki_cert certificate should be issued by the bpki_glue
       certificate; otherwise, the bpki_cert certificate should be issued
       by the bpki_cert certificate in the <self/> object.

     * bpki_glue (element): Another BPKI CA certificate for this <child/>,
       usually not needed. Certain pathological cross-certification cases
       require a two-certificate chain due to issuer name conflicts. If
       used, the bpki_glue certificate should be the issuer of the
       bpki_cert certificate and should be issued by the bpki_cert
       certificate in the <self/> object; if not needed, the bpki_glue
       certificate should be left unset.

   Control attributes that can be set to "yes" to force actions:
     * reissue: Not implemented, may be removed from protocol.

<repository/> object

   The <repository/> object represents the RPKI engine's view of a
   particular publication repository used by the current <self/> object.

   Every <repository/> object has a repository_handle, which must be
   specified for the "create", "get", "set", and "destroy" actions. Every
   <repository/> also has a self_handle attribute which indicates the
   <self/> object with which this <repository/> object is associated.

   Payload data which can be configured in a <repository/> object:
     * peer_contact_uri (attribute): HTTPS URI used to contact this
       repository.

     * bpki_cms_cert (element): BPKI CMS CA certificate for this
       <repository/>. This is used as part of the certificate chain when
       validating incoming CMS messages If the bpki_cms_glue certificate
       is in use (below), the bpki_cms_cert certificate should be issued
       by the bpki_cms_glue certificate; otherwise, the bpki_cms_cert
       certificate should be issued by the bpki_cert certificate in the
       <self/> object.

     * bpki_cms_glue (element): Another BPKI CMS CA certificate for this
       <repository/>, usually not needed. Certain pathological
       cross-certification cases require a two-certificate chain due to
       issuer name conflicts. If used, the bpki_cms_glue certificate
       should be the issuer of the bpki_cms_cert certificate and should be
       issued by the bpki_cert certificate in the <self/> object; if not
       needed, the bpki_cms_glue certificate should be left unset.

     * bpki_https_cert (element): BPKI HTTPS CA certificate for this
       <repository/>. This is like the bpki_cms_cert object, only used for
       validating incoming TLS messages rather than CMS.

     * bpki_cms_glue (element): Another BPKI HTTPS CA certificate for this
       <repository/>, usually not needed. This is like the bpki_cms_glue
       certificate, only used for validating incoming TLS messages rather
       than CMS.

   At present there are no control attributes for <repository/> objects.

<route_origin/> object

   This section is out-of-date. The <route_origin/> object has been
   replaced by the <list_roa_requests/> IRDB query, but the documentation
   for that hasn't been written yet.

   The <route_origin/> object is a kind of prototype for a ROA. It
   contains all the information needed to generate a ROA once the RPKI
   engine obtains the appropriate RPKI certificates from its parent(s).

   Note that a <route_origin/> object represents a ROA to be generated on
   behalf of <self/>, not on behalf of a <child/>. Thus, a hosted entity
   that has no children but which does need to generate ROAs would be
   represented by a hosted <self/> with no <child/> objects but one or
   more <route_origin/> objects. While lumping ROA generation in with the
   other RPKI engine activities may seem a little odd at first, it's a
   natural consequence of the design requirement that the RPKI daemon
   never transmit private keys across the network in any form; given this
   requirement, the RPKI engine that holds the private keys for an RPKI
   certificate must also be the engine which generates any ROAs that
   derive from that RPKI certificate.

   The precise content of the <route_origin/> has changed over time as the
   underlying ROA specification has changed. The current implementation as
   of this writing matches what we expect to see in
   draft-ietf-sidr-roa-format-03, once it is issued. In particular, note
   that the exactMatch boolean from the -02 draft has been replaced by the
   prefix and maxLength encoding used in the -03 draft.

   Payload data which can be configured in a <route_origin/> object:
     * asn (attribute): Autonomous System Number (ASN) to place in the
       generated ROA. A single ROA can only grant authorization to a
       single ASN; multiple ASNs require multiple ROAs, thus multiple
       <route_origin/> objects.

     * ipv4 (attribute): List of IPv4 prefix and maxLength values, see
       below for format.

     * ipv6 (attribute): List of IPv6 prefix and maxLength values, see
       below for format.

   Control attributes that can be set to "yes" to force actions:
     * suppress_publication: Not implemented, may be removed from
       protocol.

   The lists of IPv4 and IPv6 prefix and maxLength values are represented
   as comma-separated text strings, with no whitespace permitted. Each
   entry in such a string represents a single prefix/maxLength pair.

   ABNF for these address lists:

   <ROAIPAddress> ::= <address> "/" <prefixlen> [ "-" <max_prefixlen> ]
                         ; Where <max_prefixlen> defaults to the same
                         ; value as <prefixlen>.

   <ROAIPAddressList> ::= <ROAIPAddress> *( "," <ROAIPAddress> )


   For example, "10.0.1.0/24-32,10.0.2.0/24", which is a shorthand form of
   "10.0.1.0/24-32,10.0.2.0/24-24".

Operations initiated by the RPKI engine

   The left-right protocol also includes queries from the RPKI engine back
   to the IRDB. These queries do not follow the message-passing pattern
   used in the IRBE-initiated part of the protocol. Instead, there's a
   single query back to the IRDB, with a corresponding response. The CMS
   and HTTPS encoding are the same as in the rest of the protocol, but the
   BPKI certificates will be different as the back-queries and responses
   form a separate communication channel.

<list_resources/> messages

   The <list_resources/> query and response allow the RPKI engine to ask
   the IRDB for information about resources assigned to a particular
   child. The query must include both a "self_handle" attribute naming the
   <self/> that is making the request and also a "child_handle" attribute
   naming the child that is the subject of the query. The query and
   response also allow an optional "tag" attribute of the same form used
   elsewhere in this protocol, to allow batching.

   A <list_resources/> response includes the following attributes, along
   with the tag (if specified), self_handle, and child_handle copied from
   the request:
     * valid_until: A timestamp indicating the date and time at which
       certificates generated by the RPKI engine for these data should
       expire. The timestamp is expressed as an XML xsd:dateTime, must be
       expressed in UTC, and must carry the "Z" suffix indicating UTC.

     * asn: A list of autonomous sequence numbers, expressed as a
       comma-separated sequence of decimal integers with no whitespace.

     * ipv4: A list of IPv4 address prefixes and ranges, expressed as a
       comma-separated list of prefixes and ranges with no whitespace. See
       below for format details.

     * ipv6: A list of IPv6 address prefixes and ranges, expressed as a
       comma-separated list of prefixes and ranges with no whitespace. See
       below for format details.

   Entries in a list of address prefixes and ranges can be either
   prefixes, which are written in the usual address/prefixlen notation, or
   ranges, which are expressed as a pair of addresses denoting the
   beginning and end of the range, written in ascending order separated by
   a single "-" character. This format is superficially similar to the
   format used for prefix and maxLength values in the <route_origin/>
   object, but the semantics differ: note in particular that
   <route_origin/> objects don't allow ranges, while <list_resources/>
   messages don't allow a maxLength specification.

Error handling

   Error in this protocol are handled at two levels.

   Since all messages in this protocol are conveyed over HTTPS
   connections, basic errors are indicated via the HTTP response code. 4xx
   and 5xx responses indicate that something bad happened. Errors that
   make it impossible to decode a query or encode a response are handled
   in this way.

   Where possible, errors will result in a <report_error/> message which
   takes the place of the expected protocol response message.
   <report_error/> messages are CMS-signed XML messages like the rest of
   this protocol, and thus can be archived to provide an audit trail.

   <report_error/> messages only appear in replies, never in queries. The
   <report_error/> message can appear on either the "forward" (IRBE as
   client of RPKI engine) or "back" (RPKI engine as client of IRDB)
   communication channel.

   The <report_error/> message includes an optional "tag" attribute to
   assist in matching the error with a particular query when using
   batching, and also includes a "self_handle" attribute indicating the
   <self/> that issued the error.

   The error itself is conveyed in the error_code (attribute). The value
   of this attribute is a token indicating the specific error that
   occurred. At present this will be the name of a Python exception; the
   production version of this protocol will nail down the allowed error
   tokens here, probably in the RelaxNG schema.

   The body of the <report_error/> element itself is an optional text
   string; if present, this is debugging information. At present this
   capabilty is not used, debugging information goes to syslog.
